        Bingo originated in 16th century Italy as "Il Gioco del Lotto dâ€™Italia,"
        a lottery game played by the elite. By the 18th century, it had reached
        France, where it was called "Le Lotto" and became a favorite among the
        aristocracy. Its popularity spread across Europe before reaching the
        United States in the 1920s.

        In America, Edwin S. Lowe, a toy salesman, modernized the game and
        renamed it "Bingo." He collaborated with mathematician Carl Leffler to
        create thousands of unique Bingo cards. The game quickly became a
        sensation, played in churches, community centers, and even military
        camps during World War II.

        Today, Bingo continues to evolve. From traditional halls to online
        platforms, the game remains a symbol of fun and camaraderie for people
        across the globe.
